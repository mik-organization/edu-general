# NULLとEXISTS

# EXISTS(NULLが存在する場合)
SELECT * FROM customers AS c1
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT * FROM customers_2 AS c2
WHERE c1.first_name = c2.first_name AND c1.last_name = c2.last_name AND
(c1.phone_number = c2.phone_number OR (c1.phone_number IS NULL AND c2.phone_number IS NULL) ));

# NOT EXISTS
SELECT * FROM customers AS c1
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(SELECT * FROM customers_2 AS c2
WHERE c1.first_name = c2.first_name AND c1.last_name = c2.last_name AND c1.phone_number = c2.phone_number);


# NOT INの場合
-- first_name != customers_2.first_name OR last_name != customers_2.last_name OR phone_number !=customers_2.phone_number

# NOT EXISTS
-- EXISTSで紐づかなかったレコ―ド
SELECT * FROM customers AS c1
WHERE (first_name,last_name,phone_number)NOT IN
(SELECT first_name,last_name,phone_number FROM customers_2);

　# EXISTSをINで書く
SELECT * FROM customers AS c1
WHERE (first_name,last_name,phone_number)IN
(SELECT first_name,last_name,phone_number FROM customers_2);
